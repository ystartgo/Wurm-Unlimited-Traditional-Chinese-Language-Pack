The Wurm client now runs directly on LWJGL, and also includes support for some OpenGL 3+ features.\n\nTo enable this support, and to disable slow workarounds for some bugs that have been fixed, the client will reset some of the compatibility settings.\n\nThis will probably crash your client if you have Intel graphics. If it does, your old settings will be returned. You can choose cancel at this prompt to skip the reset.->

It's also possible the web server is offline or overloaded. Using a utility like ping or traceroute can help you find out which it is, if you know them.<p>You can also connect to the Wurm Online IRC channel #wurm on irc.rizon.net (<a href='http://www.rizon.net/index.php?do=chat'>browser link</a>, join the room with <kbd>/join #wurm</kbd>) to ask for help and information about the server status.<p>Even if you can't play right now, please try again later.
